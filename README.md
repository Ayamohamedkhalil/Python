 Employment Management System

 📌 Overview

Employment Management System is a console-based application developed using Python to simulate a simple company management system.

The project is designed to demonstrate a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by modeling real-world entities such as employees, offices, and company cars.


🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Apply core OOP principles in Python
* Build a modular and well-structured system
* Simulate real-world relationships between classes
* Improve clean code and project organization skills



🧠 OOP Concepts Applied

🔹 Encapsulation

Each class manages its own data and behavior.
Attributes and methods are grouped logically inside classes.

🔹 Inheritance

The Employee class inherits from the Person class, allowing shared attributes like name, age, and gender to be reused and extended.

🔹 Abstraction

Each class is responsible for its own functionality:

* Office manages employees.
* Car handles movement and fuel logic.
* Employee stores employee-specific information.

🔹 Modular Design

The project is divided into multiple files to improve readability and maintainability.



⚙️ System Features

* Add new employees
* Hire and fire employees
* Assign cars to employees
